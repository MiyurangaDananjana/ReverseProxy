The "LoadBalancingPolicy" in YARP (Yet Another Reverse Proxy) specifies the strategy used to distribute incoming requests across multiple destinations (servers) within a cluster. It defines how YARP selects the backend server to forward a request when there are multiple options available.

Supported Load Balancing Policies
First (Prioritization)

Always selects the first healthy destination in the list.
If the first destination becomes unhealthy, it falls back to the next one.
Suitable for scenarios where one server should always handle traffic unless it is down.
Example:

Destination 1: First choice.
Destination 2: Used only if Destination 1 is unhealthy.
RoundRobin (Equal Distribution)

Distributes requests evenly across all healthy destinations.
Useful for evenly balancing the load across servers.
Example:

Request 1 → Destination 1
Request 2 → Destination 2
Request 3 → Destination 1 (and so on).
PowerOfTwoChoices (Load Awareness)

Randomly selects two destinations and forwards the request to the one with the least load.
Effective in scenarios with high traffic where load-based decisions are necessary.
LeastRequests (Dynamic Balancing)

Sends requests to the destination with the fewest active requests.
Best for scenarios where server load varies dynamically, and you want to minimize congestion.
How to Configure "LoadBalancingPolicy"
In appsettings.json, you set the policy at the cluster level under the Clusters configuration.

Example: RoundRobin Policy
json
Copy code
"Clusters": {
  "cluster1": {
    "LoadBalancingPolicy": "RoundRobin",
    "Destinations": {
      "app1": { "Address": "http://192.168.8.124:8181/" },
      "app2": { "Address": "http://192.168.8.124:8282/" }
    }
  }
}


When to Use Each Policy
Policy	Use Case

First	Prioritize one destination and use others as backups.
RoundRobin	Distribute traffic equally among destinations.
PowerOfTwoChoices	Minimize load on individual servers in high-traffic environments.
LeastRequests	Ideal for dynamic workloads where some servers are more loaded than others.
