# Project Overview ‚ú®

This project demonstrates a .NET 8 application designed for testing in a live environment. It utilizes IIS as the web server, with a focus on security and performance. Redis is used for caching, and Docker is employed for containerizing and deploying Redis.

## Key Technologies üë®‚Äçüíª

* **.NET 8:** The application is built using the latest .NET 8 framework, leveraging its performance and modern features.
* **IIS (Internet Information Services):** IIS will be used as the web server to host the application. 
* **Redis:** An in-memory data store (Redis) is used for:
    * Caching frequently accessed data to improve application performance and reduce database load.
    * Implementing session management and other stateful functionalities.
* **Docker:** Containerization technology (Docker) is used for:
    * Setting up and running Redis in a consistent and isolated environment.

## Project Structure

* **Application:** Contains the core application code, including API controllers, services, and data models.
* **redis-docker-compose.yml:** Defines the Docker Compose configuration for setting up and running the Redis container.
* **.gitignore:** Specifies files and directories to be excluded from Git version control.
* **[Optional: Dockerfile]:** If you're building a custom Docker image for Redis.

## Testing in a Live Environment

**Prerequisites:**

* **Server:** A server with IIS installed.
* **Redis:** A running Redis instance (can be deployed using Docker Compose as described below).

**1. Deploy Redis using Docker Compose:**

   - Copy `redis-docker-compose.yml` to the server.
   - Execute: `docker-compose up -d` 
      - This will create and start a Docker container for Redis.

**2. Deploy the Application:**

   - Publish the .NET 8 application to the IIS server.
   - Configure the application in IIS to connect to the Redis instance.

**3. Test Application Functionality:**

   - Access the application through IIS and verify that:
      - The application responds correctly.
      - Redis is being used effectively for caching.
      - The application handles traffic load as expected.

**4. Monitoring and Troubleshooting:**

   - Monitor the application's performance and resource utilization using IIS logs and performance counters.
   - Use Docker logs to troubleshoot any issues with the Redis container.

## Considerations for a Live Environment

* **Security:** Implement robust security measures for the IIS server, including:
    * **Regular security updates:** Keep IIS and the operating system patched with the latest security updates.
    * **Application Pool Isolation:** Isolate the application in a dedicated application pool with appropriate permissions.
    * **Request Filtering:** Configure request filtering rules to block malicious requests.
    * **Web Server Hardening:** Harden the IIS server by disabling unnecessary features and services.
* **Performance:** Optimize IIS settings for performance, such as enabling output caching and compression.
* **Scalability:** If required, consider implementing a load balancing solution in front of multiple IIS servers to handle increased traffic.
* **Maintenance:** Establish a regular maintenance schedule for the application, including updates, backups, and security patches.
